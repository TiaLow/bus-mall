### Project Plan & Activity

##### **This project is to create a website for Bus Mall to do market research regarding which products they should include in their publication. They'd like to allow users to click on the product they're interested in, and see a tally of how many times a product was picked and how often it was picked as a percentage of the times it was displayed as an option. They'd like to control the number of rounds the user has the opportunity to choose a favorite. Finally, they'd like to view those results.**

#### Monday, June 15
- Initial file build, followed guidelines for setting up new 201 project
- Initial HTML scaffolding, initial css style for layout of the page
